<p>Occupy the SEC formed in 2011, when a small group of informed citizens came together to submit a <a href="../letter/OSEC%20-%20OCC-2011-14%20-%20Comment%20Letter.pdf">Comment Letter</a> to the federal agencies charged with implementing the Volcker Rule, 
an important piece of regulation that would effectively make strides towards separating investment banks from commercial banks. Since then, we have branched out into providing critiques of financial regulation more broadly. While our name
has "SEC" in it - just one agency charged with keeping the financial sector in check - we seek to occupy more than the workings of one institution. The name has stuck but our identity continues to grow. We even picked up some new members! If you live in NYC and would like to join us, or would like to help remotely, please <a href="../contact">contact us</a> and tell us what you think.</p>
