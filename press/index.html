 <br><br>
Occupy the SEC and Americans for Financial Reform Hold Press Briefing on Volcker Rule
 <br><br>
Washington, DC – April 19, 2012 -
 <br><br>
On Monday, April 23, 2012 at 4pm EST, Occupy the SEC (OSEC) and Americans for Financial Reform (AFR) will conduct a press briefing on the Volcker Rule, an important part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.  The Volcker Rule continues to make headlines, a testament to both the challenges of implementing it and the importance of doing so. The latest such headline has been an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal by the former head of global debt markets at Merrill Lynch.
 <br><br>
There will be a 15 minute presentation on the Volcker Rule, followed by Q&A’s.  We will provide an overview of the Volcker Rule, discuss common critiques of the Rule, and address its implications for financial stability and other public policy issues.   This briefing is an opportunity for members of the press to ask questions and get clarification on the Volcker Rule and its implications.
 <br><br>
Occupy the SEC is a group of concerned citizens, activists, and financial professionals with decades of collective experience working at many of the largest financial firms in the industry.  In February, Occupy the SEC filed a 325-page comment letter on the Volcker Rule NPR, which is available at http://occupythesec.org.
 <br><br>
Americans for Financial Reform is a coalition of more than 250 national, state and local consumer, labor, investor, civil rights, community, small business,  and  senior citizen organizations that have come together to spearhead a campaign for real reform.
